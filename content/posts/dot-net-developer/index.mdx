So many job advertisements with the headline "Now Hiring: .NET Developer". Unsurprisingly, they all have the same thing in common: "Required skills: Experience with .NET framework". Surprisingly, a **lot** of them tell you almost nothing else. So what is .NET? Without applying for the role, how do you know what the organization is working on, or if you're a good fit?

## What is a .NET Developer?

A .NET developer is a software engineer who specializes in building applications using the Microsoft .NET framework. The .NET framework is a powerful and versatile platform that allows developers to create a wide range of applications, from desktop applications and web applications to mobile apps and cloud-based services.

.NET developers leverage various programming languages like C#, F#, and VB.NET to create software solutions that meet specific business or user needs. They work with a comprehensive set of libraries and tools provided by Microsoft to streamline the development process and ensure the security, performance, and reliability of their applications.

## Exploring the .NET Ecosystem

The .NET ecosystem is vast, encompassing a variety of technologies and platforms. .NET developers could find themselves working on:

**ASP.NET for Web Development**

[**ASP.NET**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) is a popular framework within the .NET ecosystem for building **web applications**. Let's take a look at a simple C# code snippet that demonstrates how to create a basic web application using ASP.NET:

```csharp
using System;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

namespace MyWebApp
{
    public class Startup
    {
        public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
        {
            app.Run(async (context) =>
            {
                await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello, World!");
            });
        }
    }
}
```

**WinForms for Desktop Applications**

For developing **Windows desktop applications**, .NET developers often turn to [**Windows Forms** or **WinForms**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/winforms/). Here's a simple example of a WinForms application in C#:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Windows.Forms;

public class MyForm : Form
{
    public MyForm()
    {
        Button myButton = new Button();
        myButton.Text = "Click Me!";
        myButton.Click += (sender, e) => MessageBox.Show("Button clicked!");

        Controls.Add(myButton);
    }

    [STAThread]
    public static void Main()
    {
        Application.EnableVisualStyles();
        Application.Run(new MyForm());
    }
}
```

**Xamarin for Cross-Platform Mobile Apps**

[**Xamarin**](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin) allows .NET developers to create **cross-platform mobile apps** using C#. Here's a snippet showcasing a Xamarin.Forms button:

```csharp
using Xamarin.Forms;

public class MainPage : ContentPage
{
    public MainPage()
    {
        Button myButton = new Button
        {
            Text = "Click Me!"
        };

        myButton.Clicked += (sender, e) => DisplayAlert("Button Clicked", "Hello, Xamarin!", "OK");

        Content = new StackLayout
        {
            Children = { myButton }
        };
    }
}
```

<em>Firstly, it's important to address a concern that is often raised with FaaS, and that
is the notion of spin-up time. Conceptually, functions are not running at all
unless they are needed. This means they have to be launched to serve an
incoming request. Now, for some runtimes, it takes a long time to spin up a new
version of the runtime—often called a “cold start” time. JVM and .NET runtimes
suffer a lot from this, so a cold start time for functions using these runtimes can
often be significant.
In reality, though, these runtimes rarely cold start. On AWS at least, the runtimes
are kept “warm,” so that requests that come in are served by already launched
and running instances. This happens to such an extent that it can be difficult to
gauge the impact of a “cold start” nowadays due to the optimizations being done
under the hood by the FaaS providers. Nonetheless, if this is a concern, sticking
to languages whose runtimes have fast spin-up times (Go, Python, Node, and
Ruby come to mind) can sidestep this issue effectively.</em>

> “The Chinese use two brush strokes to write the word, 'crisis'. One brush stroke stands for danger; the other for opportunity. In a crisis, be aware of the danger - but recognize the opportunity.” - JFK  
  

The STARS response is a structured and effective method for answering behavioral interview questions. It stands for **S**ituation, **T**ask, **A**ction, **R**esult, and **S**ummary. Using this format allows you to provide a concise and structured account of your past experiences, showcasing your communication skills (usually the point of the behavioural interview) and how you go about solving problems.  
Try building your response around a "war story" - a specific example where you ended up being the hero. The keywords act as "sign-posts" so you and your interviewer don't get lost in the story.  
**Disclaimer:** Don't be shy - take credit for your achievement. However, **never** speak negatively of a colleague when explicating a problem that you happened to solve - it's a red-flag you'll be a bad culture fit.  
#### Example
**Interviewer:** *"How have you applied 'Leadership' to your previous role?"*  
In 2021, I joined the Department of Education's newly formed Digital and Blended Learning Unit, and within a week of starting, our Manager and substantive designer had to take extended leave for three months.  

**Situation:** I found myself in a **situation** where the team needed strong leadership to navigate through this unexpected absence of key personnel.

**Task:** My **task** was to interview, onboard, and train a completely new team - a new Manager, a Technology Specialist, a Project Officer, three designers, and a web development intern.  

**Action:** At the time, I was leading the online design, implementation and deployment of PLC's flagship program Core Professional Learning. The go-live was in 3 months, so it was important to take **action** immediately, leading the hiring and onboarding process without compromising the success of the CPL. I not only fulfilled my responsibilities but also took on the role of training and mentoring the new team members, and was appointed root administrator for the Performance Division's Learning Management System (LMS).

Within three months, we had a high-performing team with a diverse skillset. That year, we established Community of Practice (CoP), presented our achievements to the branch and executive director, and even set up a Digital Designer Resource Library, complete with an Azure DevOps pipeline. This resource library became a central hub for knowledge sharing and collaboration within our division, significantly improving our efficiency and effectiveness.

**Result:** As a **result** of these actions, our team became an invaluable asset to the Performance Division, establishing smooth workflows and lines of support and expertise for every business initiative.  
**Summary:** In **summary**, my ability to step up in a challenging situation, lead the team, and drive innovative initiatives demonstrated my strong commitment to the value of "Leadership" in my previous role as a Digital Learning Experience Designer.

### BEFORE THE EXAM  

#### Exam restrictions and The PSI platform

#### Practice exams
Reps, reps, reps.
#### Read the documentation (or at least, the important bits)

### DURING THE EXAM

#### Set shell variables and aliases
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/
Note: Linux Foundations tips for CKA and CKAD outline that a few aliases and command line tools have been pre-installed and preconfigured for your convenience. No need to set ```alias k=kubectl``` and Bash autocompletion.
```
export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml"
k run busybox $do > busybox.yaml
```
Force delete pods
```
export now="--force --grace-period 0"
k delete pod busybox $now
```
Aliases
```
alias kgp="kubectl get pods"
alias kgn="kubectl get nodes"
```

#### Weighting (know how to pick your battles)
My approach...

#### Relax, and breathe

### DISCLAIMER
This post will cover how I passed the exam, what to expect, the intangibles, and tips to (hopefully) set you up for success. The real-world application of the tasks you'll encounter is debatable. Just because you've passed the exam does not make you a Kubernetes expert. While you should always be learning and staying curious, the 'real-world' value of this certification (as with Azure, AWS, GCP) is debatable. I took the exam because I love challenges and learning - I still consider myself very much a novice in this domain.
### BEFORE THE EXAM  

#### Exam restrictions and The PSI platform

#### Practice exams
Reps, reps, reps. Grep, grep, grep.
#### Read the documentation (or at least, the important bits)

### DURING THE EXAM

#### Set shell variables and aliases
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/conventions/
Note: Linux Foundations tips for CKA and CKAD outline that a few aliases and command line tools have been pre-installed and preconfigured for your convenience. No need to set ```alias k=kubectl``` and Bash autocompletion.
```
export do="--dry-run=client -o yaml"
k run busybox $do > busybox.yaml
```
Force delete pods
```
export now="--force --grace-period 0"
k delete pod busybox $now
```
Aliases
```
alias kgp="kubectl get pods"
alias kgn="kubectl get nodes"
```

#### Weighting (know how to pick your battles)
The exam is worth 100 points over 120 minutes. If I 
### My approach:
1. Do a quick read-through of all questions noting the weighting. There's 100 points up for grabs in 120 minutes. Will this 7% task take more or less than 7-8 minutes?
2. As you read through, you'll no doubt find a few that you can knock over in a minute or two. I started with these. As a result, I felt confident I'd scored 30-40 points just 20 minutes into the exam.
3. At this stage, you should be left with those "this may take a while" and "I'm not 100% sure how to tackle this"
 tasks. Prioritise the high-value questions, remaining mindful that you should be looking to earn 1% every minute. 
4. Attempt all questions, and hunt for quick wins. Points can be awarded for partially completing the task. I had a strong start, but with 20 minutes left I found myself with 3 tasks weighted 4-7% each I hadn't touched. After rolling the dice with trial and error (I felt searching docs for the perfect boilerplate may consume too many precious final minutes) - I fumbled over a 4% task for 15 minutes before skipping out of frustration. I put myself in a situation where I had just 2 minutes left to attempt the final question, where I might have been lucky to scrape 1 point out of a possible 7. Upon reflection, I would have preferred to look at all 3, looking for those quick wins. Scoring 50%, 60%, & 70% on these final 3 respectively would have been a far better outcome than my estimated 90%, 10%, 40%.   
#### Relax, and breathe
Again, time is your enemy. Things like latency, tunneling and viewport issues will immediately put you at a disadvantage. When tackling a task, ensure you've fully processed the question and have a solid idea of what commands to be run.
